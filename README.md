## About Me

Since childhood, I've been inspired by **astronomy**, **physics**, and **data science**.
Alongside my dental practice, I've devoted myself to mastering **machine learning**,
driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to expand my skill set.
Imagine a dentist who dedicates his nights to unraveling the secrets of the
universe and the intricacies of data science algorithms. That’s who I strive to be.

## My Background

I grew up in a low-income neighborhood in **Port-au-Prince**, where education
was a cornerstone of my family values. My early
exposure to science through documentaries and scarce books sparked a lasting
interest in the field.

I pursued my dream at the **Faculty of Dental Medicine**, where I earned my degree.
Since then, I have worked relentlessly to enhance **oral health**, particularly
in underserved rural communities. 🦷

- **Good music** 🎶
- **Caring for my family** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **Nurturing my love for pets** 🐾

Currently, I’m enrolled in a **data science program** to fulfill my aspiration of
becoming a **data scientist**. This program allows me to blend my dental expertise
with advanced **data-driven solutions** for better community health.

## Looking Forward

As I continue my journey, I’m eager to leverage my unique background in dentistry
to develop innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on **community health**
